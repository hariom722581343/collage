# Centralized College Database Management System

This project aims to develop a robust backend system for managing student records, course details, and faculty information in a centralized college database. The system is designed to ensure data integrity, security, and accessibility while providing essential functionalities for administrators, faculty members, and students.

## Features

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure authentication system for administrators, faculty members, and students, utilizing role-based access control (RBAC) to assign different privileges.

2. **Data Model Design**: Efficient database schema to store information about departments, courses, instructors, and students, along with their relationships.

3. **Course Enrollment**: Functionalities for students to enroll in courses, preventing over-enrollment and schedule conflicts.

4. **Faculty Management**: Faculty members can view assigned courses, manage course-related information, and perform administrative tasks like adding, updating, or removing courses.

5. **Student Records Management**: Features for students to view enrolled courses, grades, academic progress, and generate transcripts and academic reports.

6. **Administrative Tasks**: Comprehensive dashboards for admins to monitor system activities, perform bulk data imports, exports, and backups securely.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several packages, each containing related classes:

- **authentication**: Classes for user authentication and authorization.
- **model**: Data model classes representing departments, courses, instructors, students, and users.
- **dao**: Data Access Object interfaces for CRUD operations on database entities.
- **enrollment**: Manager class for course enrollment and withdrawal functionalities.
- **faculty**: Manager class for faculty-related functionalities.
- **records**: Manager class for student records management.
- **admin**: Admin dashboard and functionalities for performing administrative tasks.

## Technologies Used

- Java for backend development
- SQL-based database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for data storage
- Spring Framework for dependency injection and MVC architecture (optional)
